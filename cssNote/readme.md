# Pure Simplistic CSS Note 

This project involved CSS3 techniques like the transform property to manipulate the pieces of tape. This also uses linear gradients to handle the zig-zagged borders for the tape. 

## Goal For This Project 

* I've seen plenty of websites' "About" pages and I feel like their either way too simplistic or too complex. I wanted to find a middle-ground. 
* Make it mobile-friendly (incomplete)
* To show myself that If I push myself hard enough that I can create just about any kind of shapes in CSS.
* To practice my CSS skills.
